    "### Polymorphism. \n",
    "Polymorphism is a core concept in object-oriented programming(OOP), that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of common superclass. It provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. Polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and interfaces."
