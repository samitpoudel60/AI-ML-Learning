# AI / ML Learning
This repo is where I keep everything related to my AI and Machine Learning learning. I study a little every day, practice Python, try things out, break stuff, fix it, and push whatever I learn here. I also post my daily progress on LinkedIn, so this repo basically backs up those posts.
Nothing here is meant to be perfect or polished. Most of this code is practice, revisions, and experiments as I slowly build my understanding over time. I’m focusing more on consistency than speed, and on actually understanding concepts instead of just finishing tutorials.

You’ll find Python basics and some intermediate concepts here, mostly in Jupyter notebooks. The folders are organized by topic or by day, and I keep updating old code whenever I understand things better later. Some files are simple, some are messy, and that’s completely intentional.
Right now, I’m mainly working on Python for AI and Machine Learning, getting comfortable with data handling, and building a clear understanding of core ML ideas. As I keep learning, this repo will keep changing and growing.
This repository is just a record of my learning over time. It shows progress, mistakes, and improvement, not finished projects or expert-level code.
Learning daily and getting better one step at a time.

## One last thing
Early code here is simple (and sometimes messy). That’s expected.  
This repo is about progress, not showing off.

Learning daily. Improving slowly.
